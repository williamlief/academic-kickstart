As an example, here's the distribution of teacher evaluation results across Ohio's districts in 2014:

This project is a compilation of publicly available teacher evaluation reports for US school districts. Detailed notes with the sources of all data are part of the [github repostiory](https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB), as is all code used to clean and process the data. In the repository you won't find teacher names and evaluation scores, but you will find the count of teachers receiving each rating in a district. It is not at all clear that evaluation reports are comparable across districts or states, and I urge extreme caution in attempting to directly compare results across districts. Districts with more teachers rated 'ineffective' may have worse teachers or they may simply have been more willing to engage with the evaluation tools. Similarly, districts that report all of their teachers are 'highly effective' may in fact be phenomenal, or they may have had administrators who decided that they did not want to meaningfully participate in the evaluation system.

All data for this project is currently kept privately until I ready for a public release of the data. If you are interested in getting involved please contact me.
