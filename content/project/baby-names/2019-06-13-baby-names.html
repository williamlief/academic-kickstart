<p>This project started as an examination of baby names in America using Social Security Administration Data and slowly grew into several connected projects. When my wife and I were trying to pick a name for our first child, I got fed up with all the janky websites offering up popular names and wanted to dig into the data myself. While the data analysis didn’t pick the name for us, it did help whittle down the list of names and come up with new possibilities.</p>
