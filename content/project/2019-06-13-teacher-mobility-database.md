A few years ago I embarked on a quixotic mission to build a database with every teacher in America. That ambitious dream is far from realized, but the database now has tens of millions of records from over 14 states. With this data, I am exploring teacher retention and mobility. In the future, I plan to release a public data set that includes district level summary statistics. As an example, this chart shows the distribution of teacher retention rates across districts, by state and year.

I also want to say that there are some interesting privacy questions around making public - but previously hard to access - data easily accesible. This work is not intended to be used to fuel listicles of the 'most overpaid teachers and administrators in America.' At this point I do not intend to publicly share the compiled teacher level data, though I welcome academic collaborators.
