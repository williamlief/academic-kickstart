      <title>Baby Names</title>

&lt;p&gt;This project is an examination of baby names in America using Social Security Administration Data. I started working on this project when my wife and I were trying to pick a name for our first child. I got fed up with all the janky websites offering up popular names and wanted to dig into the data myself. While the data analysis didn’t pick the name for us, it did help whittle down the list of names and come up with new possibilities. See the project code on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/williamlief/nameProject&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;popularity-over-time&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Popularity Over Time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in the most popular name by year? Want to know just how popular it is? &lt;a href=&#34;williamlief.com/post/baby-names-popular/&#34;&gt;Check out this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Baby Schedule</title>

&lt;p&gt;Our childcare provider sends us text messages with our daughter’s daily schedule: when she took a nap, when she ate, when her diaper was changed. The messages were always structured the same way, and I realized I could extract the information and create some useful graphs. It is now much easier to monitor my daughter’s patterns as she grows and changes (looking at a graph is way nicer than trying to dig through a bunch of text messages on my phone!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this a no-touch tool because I didn’t ask anyone to change anything they were doing. Too often workers are burdened with extra reporting and data entry duties, and I didn’t want to do that. This app was developed opportunisticaly as an attempt to extract and understand data that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project had three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the data from the text messages into a format I could use.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This ended up being relatively easy, macs have an sql database with all the messages, and I wrote a little query to pull them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the raw text data.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here I am fortunate that the messages were so regular. It ended up being pretty trivial to write some regex matches to get everything I needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an interactive display
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to make this data easy to look at and share interactively with my wife, so I made a simple shiny webapp (locally hosted only) to explore what was going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/williamlief/babySchedule&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. But the data I’m keeping private.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Evaluation Database</title>
      <link>https://pedantic-nobel-139058.netlify.com/project/teacher-evaluation-database/evaluationdb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 para academic introduction to project, cite kraft and gilmour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, here&amp;rsquo;s the distribution of teacher evaluation results across Ohio&amp;rsquo;s districts in 2014:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://pedantic-nobel-139058.netlify.com/teacher-evaluation-database/2019-06-13-teacher-evaluation-database_files/Ohio_evaluation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distribution of teacher evaluations in Ohio by school district&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a compilation of publicly available teacher evaluation reports for US school districts. Detailed notes with the sources of all data are part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;github repostiory&lt;/a&gt;, as is all code used to clean and process the data. In the repository you won&amp;rsquo;t find teacher names and evaluation scores, but you will find the count of teachers receiving each rating in a district. It is not at all clear that evaluation reports are comparable across districts or states, and I urge extreme caution in attempting to directly compare results across districts. Districts with more teachers rated &amp;lsquo;ineffective&amp;rsquo; may have worse teachers or they may simply have been more willing to engage with the evaluation tools. Similarly, districts that report all of their teachers are &amp;lsquo;highly effective&amp;rsquo; may in fact be phenomenal, or they may have had administrators who decided that they did not want to meaningfully participate in the evaluation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data for this project is currently kept privately until I ready for a public release of the data. If you are interested in getting involved please contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Payroll Database</title>
      <link>https://pedantic-nobel-139058.netlify.com/project/teacherdb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I embarked on a quixotic mission to build a database with every teacher in America. That ambitious dream is far from realized, but the database now has tens of millions of records from over 14 states. With this data, I am exploring teacher retention and mobility. In the future, I plan to release a public data set that includes district level summary statistics. As an example, this chart shows the distribution of teacher retention rates across districts, by state and year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INSERT CHART&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to say that there are some interesting privacy questions around making public - but previously hard to access - data easily accesible. This work is not intended to be used to fuel listicles of the &amp;lsquo;most overpaid teachers and administrators in America.&amp;rsquo; At this point I do not intend to publicly share the compiled teacher level data, though I welcome academic collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the project code on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/williamlief/teacherDB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an r-package I have developed to contain a collection of helpful functions that I find useful for data analysis. Most of these functions are very simple, but save me from having to type out the same five lines of code over and over again. As some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;summarize_mean&lt;/code&gt; takes a dataset and returns the mean value of every variable in it. The function also allows an optional grouping parameter, and will return a wide tibble with one row per variable and one column per group level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;g_sample&lt;/code&gt; takes a random sample of groups within a grouped tibble, instead of a random sample of rows within each group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;balance_panel&lt;/code&gt; takes panel data, and removes all the units that are missing observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is fully documented in R, see the help index for a full list of functions. Note that this package will change frequently, and I make no promises about preserving backwards compatibility. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in using any of the tools, I suggest forking the repository and maintaining your own version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install using &lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;williamlief/liefTools&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; or check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/williamlief/liefTools&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
