Interestingly, a lot of classically popular names, (Mary, Jennifer, John, or Michael) aren’t on the list at all. In this post I explore some of the trends in name popularity over time.\n Table 1: 2017’s most popular names  rank F M    1 Emma Liam  2 Olivia Noah  3 Ava William  4 Isabella James  5 Sophia Logan  6 Mia Benjamin  7 Charlotte Mason  8 Amelia Elijah  9 Evelyn Oliver  10 Abigail Jacob     Three Questions  What are the most popular names historically?  Mary and John are the most popular names given to babies, but they built up a huge lead in the 1800’s.  How popular was the most popular name in different years?  About 1.2% of girls today are named Emma, but in 1880, 7.8% of girls were named Mary. About 1% of boys today are named Liam, but in 1880, 8.7% of boys were named John.  How has the number of unique names given changed over time?  In 1880, 95% of babies were given one of 800 names (400 girl names and 400 boy names). Today, 95% of babies are given one of 12,000 names (7,700 girl names and 4,400 boy names).    Historical Most Popular Names Here we see all the names that have ever been the most popular for a year, and the number of times they have held that honor. Mary was the most popular name for girls in 76 years. Our data only covers 138 years, and Mary was the most popular name for more than half of it. John and Michael are tied for most popular men’s name, having been the most popular name in 44 years each.\n  Name Sex Years Most Popular    Mary F 76  John M 44  Michael M 44  Robert M 17  Jennifer F 15  Jacob M 14  James M 13  Emily F 12  Jessica F 9  Lisa F 8  Linda F 6  Emma F 5  Noah M 4  Sophia F 3  Ashley F 2  Isabella F 2  David M 1  Liam M 1     How Popular was the Most Popular Name? The most popular name today is much less popular than it used to be! In the graph below we see that the most popular name in each year becomes much less popular over time. In 1880, Mary was the most popular girls name and was given to almost 8% of baby girls! But today the most popular girls name is Emma and is given to just 1.1% of girls. With a few exceptions, the most popular name for boys was a bit more popular than the most popular girls name, but it, too, has declined in popularity. The points on the graph show when the most popular name changed, we will explore those changes below.\n What was the most popular name? Here we list the most popular name, the year when it changed, and what percent of babys it was given to. Mary reigned for girls from 1880 until 1946. In 1947 Linda surged in popularity and took the title. Linda’s time was short lived however, and in 1953, Mary reclaimed the title, but at a fraction of her former popularity. For Men, the 1950’s were a contentious time with James giving way to Robert in 1953, Michael claiming the crown in 1954, only losing it to David for a year in 1960.\nIts interesting to note that there has been a fairly steady decrease in the popularity of the most popular name over time, but its only in the last forty years that people have really begun branching out into new names.\n  Year  Name  Percent  Name  Percent      1880  John  8.7  Mary  7.8    1924  Robert  5.4      1940  James  5.4      1947    Linda  5.6    1953  Robert  4.4  Mary  3.4    1954  Michael  4.3      1960  David  4.0      1961  Michael  4.1      1962    Lisa  2.3    1970    Jennifer  2.6    1985    Jessica  2.8    1991    Ashley  2.3    1993    Jessica  1.9    1996    Emily  1.4    1999  Jacob  1.8      2008    Emma  1.0    2009    Isabella  1.2    2011    Sophia  1.2    2013  Noah  1.0      2014    Emma  1.2    2017  Liam  1.0        The Explosion in Name Variety In the plots below we see that there has recently been a massive increase in the number of different names used. Between 1880 and 1960 roughly half of baby girls were given one of fifty unique names. For boys, there was even less variety, with half of boys receiving one of just thirty names. Now there are about five times as many (250) unique names on the list that covers half of baby girls, and five times as many (150) on the list for boys. At the extreme, we can see that we’ve gone from 400 names covering 95% of baby boys and girls in 1880 to needing 7,700 girl names and 4,400 boy names to cover 95% of births today.\n ","date":1560470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560530199,"objectID":"bde54e5e274de7ef480d3af7ff54396c","permalink":"/post/baby-names-posts/baby-names-popular/","publishdate":"2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/baby-names-posts/baby-names-popular/","section":"post","summary":"A look at name popularity over time","tags":["side"],"title":"The Most Popular Names","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" This project is an examination of baby names in America using Social Security Administration Data.

This ended up being relatively easy, macs have an sql database with all the messages, and I wrote a little query to pull them.  Parse the raw text data.  Here I am fortunate that the messages were so regular. It ended up being pretty trivial to write some regex matches to get everything I needed.

Detailed notes with the sources of all data are part of the github repostiory, as is all code used to clean and process the data. In the repository you won\u0026rsquo;t find teacher names and evaluation scores, but you will find the count of teachers receiving each rating in a district. It is not at all clear that evaluation reports are comparable across districts or states, and I urge extreme caution in attempting to directly compare results across districts. Districts with more teachers rated \u0026lsquo;ineffective\u0026rsquo; may have worse teachers or they may simply have been more willing to engage with the evaluation tools. Similarly, districts that report all of their teachers are \u0026lsquo;highly effective\u0026rsquo; may in fact be phenomenal, or they may have had administrators who decided that they did not want to meaningfully participate in the evaluation system.\nAll data for this project is currently kept privately until I ready for a public release of the data.

The function also allows an optional grouping parameter, and will return a wide tibble with one row per variable and one column per group level. g_sample takes a random sample of groups within a grouped tibble, instead of a random sample of rows within each group. balance_panel takes panel data, and removes all the units that are missing observations.
